## Hello, world!

My name is Wallace Correa, i'm a Civil Engineering student with emphasis in hydric and environmental resources at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

I'm a statistics and numbers enthusiast, currently working as an intern in a Data Engineering team and doing undergraduate research on mathematical modeling, as well as some other personal projects. I also study web development (mainly backend-oriented), having participated in some projects, both personally and as a freelancer.

I look forward to dive deeper into the data world and eventually get a full time position as a Data Scientist, Data Engineer or even Back-end Developer.

- :alien: My main technologies are Python, SQL, AWS/GCP and JavaScript
- :books: I am, above all, very passionate about learning new things and always aiming to work with new stuff!


**Some of my work:**

- [Pythology - Python package for simulating epidemiological compartmental models](https://github.com/wallco/pythology) 
- [KNN Classifier for predicting League of Legends match results](https://www.kaggle.com/wallacecorrea/knn-modeling-for-match-result-prediction-73)
